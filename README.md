# mtg-legacy-data

For my analysis of the Legacy format of Magic: The Gathering, I needed a lot of decklists. To do so, I scrapped the content of [mtgtop8](https://www.mtgtop8.com); see the [spider_mtg repo](https://github.com/pfr974/spider_mtg) for more details. I created this folder for people to be able to access those files. Each file corresponds to a year (https://www.mtgtop8.com/format?f=LE&meta=199). In each file, each line corresponds to a complete decklist, mainboard, and sideboard.
